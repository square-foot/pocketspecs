Pocket Specs is a simple, yet sophisticated tool for developers working with Pocketbase SaaS applications. 
It offers a unique approach that combines code generation with iterative development. 

Here are its key strengths:

 * Reduced Code Writing: Pocket Specs can potentially reduce the amount of code a developer needs to write by up to 50%.
 * Iterative Development: It allows for a "Kaizen" style of development, where functionality can be added incrementally.
 * Separation of Concerns: It enforces a disciplined approach by separating route definitions, event handlers, and utility functions.
 * Commenting: It encourages commenting right across the project.
 * Code Reusability: It allows for creating reusable patterns stored in separate files.
 * Integration with Code Editors: It works well with code editors like VS Code, providing auto-completion and syntax highlighting. 


Not open source
===============
This is not an open source project. The compiler used for this project; Visual Prolog Version 5.2
is not available for public use and nor is it being distributed/sold.

This is donation ware.

Anyone who donates >= $50 USD will be able to show a small advert (related to software industry)
as Pocket Specs runs without a build-run (i.e. when it is building a project, adverts are not shown)

Donations can be made to Sabu Francis https://paypal.me/sabufrancis

The utility can be downloaded here: https://github.com/square-foot/pocketspecs
IMPORTANT: Download the entire  repository as a zip file

Extract the zip file into a Windows computer (Version 8 or >)
NO registry stuff. To uninstall, just delete the folder and its contents.
